_ Remarks

I should make the following remarks:

- Text in the same paragraph should be on the same line. In TextWrangler, for example, you can change the view to enable soft text wrapping. Just click on View > Text Display > Soft Wrap Text.
- Pay close attention to where blank lines are located.
- Double line breaks are ignored. Line breaks within lists are ignored.
